<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tesujimath/gitmoto/main/examples/images/gitmoto-early-screenshot.png" alt="Early screenshot of gitmoto"/>

## Current status

This is a work-in-progress.

- filesystem scanner for finding git work trees
- run configured git client on selected repo
- filtering to repos of interest
- only cares about primary worktrees, so bare git repos and secondary worktrees are ignored
